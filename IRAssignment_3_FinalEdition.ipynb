The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one. There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.

In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.

These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.

It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for \"general\" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook. And in building this portion of the collection, \"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.\" This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us.',\n",

For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is referred to the references cited. For automation these references are only a modest selection from an enormous literature.',\n",

At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972, LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the 'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this seminar. The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre for the collection of such material, to be available for loan. The provision of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas. The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19 September 1973.\",\n",

Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world.',\n",

To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.

He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals. In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject.',\n",

Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.

However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures. These were primarily groups, rings and lattices. The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935). During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations. Such sets are now called models. In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic. The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems. And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus. Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra.\",\n",

Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system. Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems. This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term. On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity.',\n",

Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries.\",\n",

In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user. A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless. The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries. However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries. Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives. Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function. As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.',\n",

One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information.

This second stream of research we will call technology. Far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists.

Most researchers have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963; Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964). There seemed to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large numbers of papers or the life\\'s work of large numbers of scientists. The invention of the Science Citation Index (SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool to measure the significance of individual scientists\\' contributions. Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large number of journals. The number of citations an individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator of the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of that individual\\'s publications.',\n",

Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important. For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data. Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems. This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media. Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities. In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information. This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science.\",\n",

The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures. Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year\\'s chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.',\n",

However, \"design\" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations. \"Evaluation\" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems. Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment. Thus, portions of \"design\" and \"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.

It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year. A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas. First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded. Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter. Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation.\",\n",

This field, which will be referred to as \"Information Science and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices. The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use. Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future. To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology. There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.

At the same time, \"core\" chapters of the review are continued: information needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation; and professional aspects of information science. These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their annual literature is significant, large, and growing.',\n",

There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields.

When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to \"the information problem.\" This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue.

The increasing interest in and movement toward library networks and other cooperative, technology-supported information activities have helped to focus special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology, the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems, but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications. Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use information-handling systems. Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems and information systems in state and local government. While the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral areas some information parallels. Indeed, one of the reasons for the Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving techniques they are fostering.\",\n",

The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing. The application of computer technology to libraries, especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions, is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment. It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers. Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole. The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library.

Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only stagnant, but regressive. With social memory, preserved and controlled by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment. Archives were the forerunners of libraries. The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society. Today, archives and libraries are necessities. These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media. In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals. The materials in these institutions contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions, develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.\",\n",

These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search. The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts. ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work. Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type.\",\n",

Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies. As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus. A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed. Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted. A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies. This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management. This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent). Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.\",\n",

One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method: The overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study: A small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them.

In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly. One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated. Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions. It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis. The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on. Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology. On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.\",\n",

There are a number of possible reasons for this. Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions. There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems. Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research. This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages. There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark. On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies. There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field.\",\n",

By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of an inquirer. If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory. The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates. The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher. The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the IDC-system and its precursors. These postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development.',\n",

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their total productivity would go up by a factor of ten. He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted. It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant. Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information. I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation. The big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change, select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information.\",\n",

Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836). His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finite means\" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming). What is more, it seems that even Panini\\'s grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a \"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term. This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion. What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated. This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar. For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.',\n",

Citations from 109 clinically-oriented journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and 5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center..

The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927. This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation. Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals. According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry. Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined. These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted equally.',\n",

Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests are practical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible..

In assessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on its typical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these tests are being used in a national survey..

Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services.. One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single figure..

The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing)..

In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.',\n",

As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis.

The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services. This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969. Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved. Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs. The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle. Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system. Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted. A secondary objective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center.',\n",

This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly convenient way of arranging books on shelves. Some librarians think it is, and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like the Classification Research Group, actually spend years of their time in theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise. Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography) for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians, and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed. In the next field, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding away at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results that impress computer specialists but not information users, who are so deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new.',\n",

Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins. In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories. Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory. Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of intellectual confrontation.

First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it. This situation is, of course, well known. Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory. However, these should be relatively few. In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question. So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S. Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list. Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question. More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set.\",\n",

              "  'abstract': 'The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text. When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory\\'s prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future.',\n",

Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood. The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.\",\n",

Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey, or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification; organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational methods; and continuing education needs. The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations. However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions. In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure. Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4. Throughout the text, when issues are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of opinions expressed, these areas are identified.',\n",

This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear distinction for the purposes of this work. Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied for library purposes. Local public libraries, systems of public libraries, and state library agencies are included in this category. School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of schools whether they be public, private, or parochial. School libraries at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are included. Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which, while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known for their research resources. Junior college libraries, college libraries, university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries. The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries. Special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined information needs. Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of nonprofit organizations are common examples. While distinctions between research and special libraries are not always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no serious problems are created.\",\n",

(2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.

Processes and methods which formerly were discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities continue to appear.

These examples are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, capitalization, transliteration, etc. In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of another country or another language. In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been complemented by references to professional literature on the subject available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed there. Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users' approach to corporate headings. It is well understood and appreciated that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for corporate headings present more problems than any other type of heading.

We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research. Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them. From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions. Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation. Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses. We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.\",\n",

For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio. A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future.

What specific steps can the library take to improve its services? What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems? For how long should the library allow books to be checked out? How frequently should overdue notices be sent out? Is an investment in a security system worthwhile?

It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached. To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts. We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665. Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials. Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number. The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular. Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000. In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology). There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at a very high level indeed.',\n",

Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems. To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact. Relatively little objective data have been obtained. This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner. This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner. This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields. However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.\",\n",

The much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication. For any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results.',\n",

My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education. Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological, neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics. The study then progresses to an exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society, together with the place of the library in it.',\n",

For documentation and information retrieval in general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available. That classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is, however, made evident in two ways. First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques. Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge. It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared. The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed. These developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology. There is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification.\",\n",

Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one. The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy. The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability. As a national resource for underwriting further economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a factor of major importance.\",\n",

We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics. This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description. It has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance. Only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.

It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite. Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world. Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world. The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide. A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser. This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI). A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry. It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks.

Where one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth. This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different from that of the first. But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's processing problems. The changes from the first edition therefore represent not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first edition.\",\n",

A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision..

While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of \"good index terms\", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms.. Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..',\n",

The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development. An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.

No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have. It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost. The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.',\n",

Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..',\n",

The measure of performance was an estimate of the recall ratio.. To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted below.. (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant searching operators.. (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to improving the cost-performance of the system..

The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy\\'s, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified. A solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen- space and dubbing the happy couple the \"distinctive title.\"',\n",

For the most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12)..

Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of lending library, the size of collection, budget for current acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.',\n",

The documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated.. Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or 48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula.. The experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique..',\n",

It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry..

The concept of a natural language information system is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated language processing effort by computational linguists and information scientists. In terms of this framework, the former have concentrated on automating the operations of the component for content analysis and representation, while the latter have emphasized the data management component. The complementary nature of these developments allows the postulation of an integrated approach to automated language processing.

Bayesian statistics are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and without document classification information.. Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification analysis..

Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958.. The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968.. Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index..',\n",

In previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency..',\n",

Other compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form.. These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA) for over two years..

Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user..

Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users\\' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users\\' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading.. In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD.. The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study..',\n",

The 300 articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during this four-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate by year serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during the third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citation were noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, 15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic journals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of the citations were found in these journals..

Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (\"both-way\" communication)..

              "  'abstract': 'Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" are retrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providing or \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic joints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" and it is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..',\n",

The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance.. The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely on the \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..',\n",

The former approach has been favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed.. The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document..

Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical..

This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures.

Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been integrated into CAS indexing operations. The third refinement of this system, Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques for registering chemical substances. The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring. These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system. The general design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic segments, is presented.',\n",

The reader can draw several obvious conclusions. About half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950's.

Another striking fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself. In Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations is 21.3. To some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work.

For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man.. To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc.. Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II.. The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..',\n",

In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification. By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.

It was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another.. Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarily obtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation studies..\",\n",

In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford or Zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical literature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in the cumulative yield from a given input. The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is, the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant. This type of behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from meteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations appropriate to the particular fields.

Numerous studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.

When, in the early 1950's, various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments. In an editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint, shared by many others, when he wrote: Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems. May the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future. There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and costs. The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid intellectual discipline.\",\n",

This implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'. Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.

Fron analysis of these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes.. A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library.. The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns..

As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field..

PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases. The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system.',\n",

Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere. Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM). While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.\",\n",

              "  'abstract': 'In traditional classification schemes, the universe of knowledge is broken down into self-contained disciplines which are further analysed to the point at which a particular concept is decated.. This leads to problems of: (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries.. (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects.. (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it fits as logically into one discipline as another.. Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears.. The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts.. Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and Attributes as its vocabulary..',\n",

The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..',\n",

The basic purpose of this research is curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting them. Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced librarians.\",\n",

Furthermore, using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction..

The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson\\'s A History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues as announced to cover only libraries. Its attention to librarianship is very limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned. Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian. The aim here has been to tie it all together. In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: European civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere progeny. The limitation is practical. To try to \"cover\" even the West may prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash. Yet an understanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all. Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.',\n",

Taking under consideration the study of \"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications. There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them. These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world. It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings.

A quick check of her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. She recorded nine opponents of the divided catalog and six better known members of the profession reserving judgement. Lyle in his new edition of The Administration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\" as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries. The following questions were asked of all users of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks: 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject? Were you looking under author, title, or subject? 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog? 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file? One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a separate catalog, 5 per cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.',\n",

Relatively secure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless frequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably obscure. The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable. In the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather. In 12 years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library. I think the experience is not uncommon. Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive. Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic success.

It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed. In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines. Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions. The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others.\",\n",

He questions its advocates' claim that it best meets a library's needs. He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields. We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957). Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog. During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937. Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.\",\n",

Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library. Weeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries.

It takes into account the grammatical and semantic context of words, it is able to generate meaningful and valid base forms that are real words and are closer to the original word's meaning. In contrast, stemming relies on rule-based truncation that can result in stemming errors or produce stems that are not always valid words or may not represent the actual root form of the word."

Techniques included are (a) Bradford analysis, (b) epidemic analysis, (c) identification of research front, and (d) bibliographic coupling.. Similar analysis was made of writings cited by the main corpus articles, and of the literature which in turn cites the main corpus.. Results were analyzed in terms of structure and processes observable in patterns of authorship, publication, and citation.. Their significance is discussed with potential application of the method to the solution of problems in the management of large research libraries..\n",

Political analysis is required, and Easton's conceptual framework is presented to suggest the utility of political analysis.. A list of normative issues is derived from raising descriptive questions about the politics of university libraries..\n",

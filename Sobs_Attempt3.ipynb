Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers.

Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world.',\n",

              "  'abstract': 'In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates. He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals. In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject.',\n",

A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation. Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession. It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries. They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call \"professional.\"',\n",

However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures. These were primarily groups, rings and lattices. The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935). During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations. Such sets are now called models. In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic. The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems. And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus. Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra.\",\n",

Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system. Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems. This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term. On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity.',\n",

Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles..

Complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies..

A probability model of expected distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their eminence grows..

Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries.\",\n",

In an ecological correlation the statistical object is a group of persons. The correlation between the percentage of the population which is Negro and the percentage of the population which is illiterate for the 48 states, shown later as Figure 2, is an ecological correlation. The thing described is the population of a state, and not a single individual. The variables are percentages, descriptive properties of groups, and not descriptive properties of individuals.',\n",

When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time. They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival. They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled.',\n",

Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important. For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data. Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems. This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media. Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities. In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information. This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science.\",\n",

              "  'abstract': 'The major trends of the 1970\\'s in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year\\'s Annual Review chapters. The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures. Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year\\'s chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.',\n",

In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components. However, \"design\" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations. \"Evaluation\" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems. Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment. Thus, portions of \"design\" and \"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies. Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.

It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year. A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas. First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded. Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter. Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation.\",\n",

This field, which will be referred to as \"Information Science and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices. The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use. Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future. To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology. There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.

The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing.

It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers.

For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index. These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search. The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts. ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work. Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type.\",\n",

Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies. As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus. A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed. Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted. A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies. This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management. This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent). Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.\",\n",

It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems. One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method: The overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study: A small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them.

In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly. One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated. Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions. It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis. The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on. Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology.

There are a number of possible reasons for this. Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions. There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems. Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research. This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages. There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.

If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory. The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates. The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher. The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the IDC-system and its precursors. These postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development.',\n",

He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted. It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant. Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information. I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation.

His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finite means\" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).

As the strength of national professional associations of practitioners has increased, concern with education for the professions has prompted schools to develop standards and curricula to support the preparation of practitioners. During the half century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed national associations. The Association of American Medical Colleges, for example, was established in 1876. Other professional school associations followed: engineering (1893), law (1900), librarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919). These associations, to cite a few, have developed in different ways while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels of influence in affecting professional education.',\n",

Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work.

In contrast to the bigot of the older style he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs. He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others, jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power and authority.

For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example. Equally, in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument; but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this, or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.',\n",

The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and 5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity..',\n",

The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927. This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation. Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals. According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry. Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined. These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted equally.',\n",

Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs.. Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors.. Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals such as researches and clinicians in the same environment.. With respect to environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..

Selected aspects of the descriptive data obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services.. One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single figure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical regions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey data for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most important of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and recommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate for the Medical Library Association..',\n",

The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service..

In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.',\n",

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis. A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others.

The CALBPC project was begun in 1965 by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort to establish a centralized acquisition and processing center. The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services. This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969. Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved. Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs. The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle. Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system. Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted. A secondary objective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center.',\n",

Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider. Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins. In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories. Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory. Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of intellectual confrontation.

This situation is, of course, well known. Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory. However, these should be relatively few. In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question. So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S. Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list. Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question. More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set.\",\n",

              "  'abstract': 'The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text. When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory\\'s prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future.',\n",

These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information. Many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear. Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood. The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.\",\n",

At the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge. What is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification. The need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge.

Junior college libraries, college libraries, university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries. The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries. Special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined information needs.

From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions. Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation. Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses. We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.\",\n",

The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past. For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio. A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future. The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy. Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole.',\n",

To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from the past, but we have yet to convert them into history. The lack has cost the profession dearly. Even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts. There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of American library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.

Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move. To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.

It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached. To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts. We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665. Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials. Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number. The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular. Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000. In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).

              "  'abstract': \"Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information. Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems. To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact. Relatively little objective data have been obtained. This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner. This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner. This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields. However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.\",\n",

First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques. Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge. It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared. The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.

The fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars. The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered. Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described. These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine. The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown. The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability.',\n",

What can be done about giving informal communication, without destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of the advantages of formal communication, such as, general accessibility, permanence, etc.?

To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels. In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel.',\n",

Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has gradually been elaborated by our research group. We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics. This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description. It has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance. Only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book. We do not present a complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart to the new version of transformational grammar. We have simply tried to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the development of a new alternative.\",\n",

It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite. Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world. Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world. The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide. A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser. This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI). A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry. It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks. Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second.',\n",

Both attempts only partially succeed. Konigova proposes three types: formal relevance, subject/content relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency). This classification has validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less precise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses the ambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" - presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of the enquirer. And in her mathematics, as she admits, \"no account is taken of the subjective relevance (pertinence).\" Yet this is surely the true aim of the system.',\n",

The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a seven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated \"research\" and \"nonresearch\".. A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel..

Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision..

In the first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. The sentences selected by the extracting algorithm were representative and are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases.. There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items..',\n",

Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..',\n",

(1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant searching operators.. (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to improving the cost-performance of the system.. (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these factors will improve system cost-performance..',\n",

This prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search, particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the methods sufficient for his personal file.. The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of fundamental notions such as \"information\" and \"order\".. This gives him a better understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently, even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to make such operations more \"objective\" and formal..

Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third of the interlibrary loan requests they receive. Unfilled interlibrary loans are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the usefulness of the service to the reader. Many of these interlibrary loan failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted.',\n",

Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check in advance the lending policies before sending requests. The major elements determining whether or not libraries receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists, especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong collections in a subject field listed in library directories. Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of lending library, the size of collection, budget for current acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.',\n",

With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore..

              "  'abstract': 'A decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in response to a specific user query for information.. A thorough discussion of decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature, outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and without document classification information.. Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem, incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation, which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many researchers in this crucial area..',\n",

Only seven misses and three false drops occurred.. Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were identified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors: (1) partial identifications in which some citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program (\"short hits\"); and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included in the citations (\"long hits\"). Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program.. The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run, the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text was approximately 15 1/2 minutes..

When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library..

To fulfill this responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit reliable information concerning courses being offered relating to information storage and retrieval, information science and/or documentation. The data requested included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses, textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which offered, etc. Responses were received from 45 schools, providing information about 185 courses and 242 topics. Using several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and scatter of the topics included in this field. It was therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which would examine the validity of the questionnaire results. This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh on September 21-23, 1970. Sixteen specialists in the field representing universities industry and government were brought together to participate. Consensus was reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to the curriculum in information science and seven courses which constitute the core for the Master's program. The topics to be included in each of these courses were also isolated.\",\n",

The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components, and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form.. These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA) for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..

Consequently, the process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the information available in te system, remains one of the principal problems in information retrieval today.. In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem into the structure and vocabulary of the system..\",\n",

              "  'abstract': 'A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system.. Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users\\' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users\\' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading.. In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD.. The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study..',\n",

In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating..

Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" are retrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providing or \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic joints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" and it is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better..

The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance.. The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely on the \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..',\n",

The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document..

But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..

All these methods require cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how to dismember correctly each structure to be coded. A disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore, that they are not generally understood by chemists. No advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to generate and how to interpret a chemical code. Codes are needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical structures. Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would relieve the chemist of considerable burden.',\n",

The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained along with the more interesting algorithmic results. The role of the WLN-generation programs in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed.

These names are more easily derived from molecular structural diagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users. Machine editing of index names and translation of these names into structural representations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aided by the revisions. The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all \"trivial\" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplification of general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment for certain classes of substances. Specific identifiable alloys, elementary particles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventional chemical substances.

For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected. To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures. A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report. This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures. Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts. Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples. Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed.

An analysis of the information transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used as synonyms. Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal articles. In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value. Titles in chemistry are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the underlying information transfer principles.',\n",

For purposes of comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2. The results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4. The reader can draw several obvious conclusions. About half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950's. This, in part, reflects the present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation and its rapid expansion in recent years. Another striking fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself. In Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations is 21.3. To some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work. However, it seems to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these journals in their respective fields.

It can be large in the sense of having a large number of fields or data elements, which implies a degree of complexity. It can be thought of as large in the sense of having a large number of searchable or selectable elements, and it also can be large in the most readily understandable sense of having a large number of characters in storage.',\n",

For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man.. To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc.. Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II.. The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..',\n",

For comparability of results, certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..

In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification. By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.

It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..

The aim was to assess the effect, if any, of the considerable measures taken since the 1962 survey.. Uncontrolled factors, mainly related to the rapid expansion of the University, may. however, have effected the results.. It appears that, except for social science students, there were few improvements in attitudes and use, and that seminars had little measurable effect.. Possible explanations for this are offered, and the place of reader services in a university library discussed.. Other items covered by the survey include the use of libraries in Halls of resinence and of Southampton Public Libraries, which in both cases showed a sharp decline since 1962, the number and cost of books bought by undergraduates, and their use of libraries in vacations..',\n",

The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is, the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.

May the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future. There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and costs.

Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.

The consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject..

This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938..

A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study..

From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed.. Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff, than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, or computer programming..

PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases. The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system.',\n",

Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere. Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM). While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.\",\n",

(c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it fits as logically into one discipline as another.. Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears.. The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts..

The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..',\n",

The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of our Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate to his current and emerging needs. Confronting this goal requires a recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change. The national interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets of illiteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement.',\n",

If one ignored the major historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read), notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental needs. The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson\\'s A History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues as announced to cover only libraries. Its attention to librarianship is very limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned. Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian. The aim here has been to tie it all together. In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: European civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere progeny. The limitation is practical. To try to \"cover\" even the West may prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash. Yet an understanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all. Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.',\n",

Taking under consideration the study of \"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications. There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them. These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world. It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings. The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year.

Lyle in his new edition of The Administration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\" as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries. The following questions were asked of all users of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks: 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject? Were you looking under author, title, or subject? 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog? 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file? One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a separate catalog, 5 per cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.',\n",

The threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably obscure. The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable. In the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather. In 12 years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library. I think the experience is not uncommon. Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive.

Unfortunately, the picture many faculty members have of what today\\'s requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete. Graduates are thus doubly handicapped. Not only do we fail to educate, we fail even to provide realistic training. At worst, we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries. Library education, like the public library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion. Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive. Others will wither away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies. There is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both. An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called \"Dust Gathers on the Public Library\" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is dead - while the public library lives on).',\n",

What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis. In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years. It is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements. With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow. In addition to identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future.\",\n",

Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; therefore, significant results can often be obtained with smaller samples and in shorter periods of observation. People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail disclosures about basic processes. Elsewhere professional employees are obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative committees.

We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957). Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog. During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937.

Over two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world, and in a variety of library journals. The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments. There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS. Over 50 percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report, and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS system. Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall value cannot help but be colored by this connection.\",\n",

The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing (enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which each particular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple, incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture of the system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated in detail.  Linguistic models, knowledge representation, and parsing algorithms are described and illustrated by means of selected examples.  Performance evaluations of the system in the application version on data base inquiry are reported and discussed.  Promising directions for future research are presented in the conclusions.',\n",

The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.  The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.\",\n",

It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators (SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in their titles.

The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall simultaneously.

Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere, is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers. This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, which is being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's Science Information Services.\",\n",

The analysis assumes that the more two authors are cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw data are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows (1) identifiable author groups (akin to \"schools\") of information science, (2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of authors within group and across group boundaries (\"border authors\" who seem to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with respect to the map\\'s axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis of authors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the extent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The technique establishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit in analyzing subject specialties.',\n",

This, however, is changing rapidly and investment on a large scale is already taking place in manhy areas as present-day inflation bites hard, forcing many companies and organizations to take a much closer look at their office operations.',\n",
